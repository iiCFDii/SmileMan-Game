# SmileMan-Game
We created a game similar to PackMan utilizing OpenGL, Javascript. 
The player has to avoid getting hit by the enemy monster. This monster is able to move around and follow the player. In order to win the player must collect all of the coins, but if the player gets hit by the monster, it is game over. Each round the monsters speed gets faster and faster. See how many rounds you can last :)

Here is a link to play the game in the web browser: https://smileman-game.iicfdii.repl.co/
